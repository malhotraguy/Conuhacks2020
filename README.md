# Donate Time

Project for ConUHacks in which volunteers sign up as volunteers through a form, and get matched with companies who are looking for volunteers with their skillset and interests. Availabilities are synced up with google calendars, and when the volunteer accepts the job, their calendar gets updated. The volunteers who accept the same job get added to a group chat, in which they can contribute through multiple different messaging services.
